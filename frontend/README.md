# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Getting Started

In order to run this project, you need to have bun installed on your machine. You can install bun by running the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.2.7"
```
After installing bun, you can run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
After installing the dependencies, you can run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

In order for the application to work, you need to have the backend server running. You'll also need to set the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to the URL of the backend server in a `.env` file. For example, if the backend server is running at `http://localhost:8000`, you can create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```


## Generating the API Client
To generate the API client, you can run the following command:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=$VITE_BACKEND_URL bun run build:client
```
This will generate the API client in the `src/client` directory. The API client is generated using the OpenAPI specification file located at generated by the app server. The OpenAPI specification file is located at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` when the app server is running. For example with this URL you can run the following command:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000 bun run build:client
```

## Building the Application
To build the application for production, you can run the following command:

```bash
bun run build
```
This will create a `dist` directory with the production build of the application. You can then serve the application using a static file server or deploy it to a hosting service.
